# ZyboSLAMBot
This project explores the synergy between hardware acceleration and robotic autonomy by leveraging the Xilinx Zynq-7020 SoC on the Zybo Z7 development board. With the integration of ROS for middleware and SLAM for environmental mapping and localization, the system will demonstrate modular and scalable robot control suitable for academic research or lightweight real-world applications. The ultimate goal is to create a reproducible, low-power SLAM-enabled robotic system that exemplifies the potential of FPGA-based co-processing in mobile robotics.
